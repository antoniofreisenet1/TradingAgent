# TradingAgent
My final project for the University of Seville. It consists of a reinforcement learning trading agent using a DeepQ-based neural network, following the OpenAI Gym agents architecture. Inspired mainly by the paper created by Gyeeung Jong and Ha Young Kim in 2018, among several other projects. Stored in branch master for the time.
